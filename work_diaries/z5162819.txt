WEEK 01
This week the group of 5 was formed and Jira, Confluence and GitHub were set up. As a team we discussed which project 
we would like to undertake and decided on the ReadRecommend system. We had a group meeting and created a draft of all
the user stories for our project and decided on rolls for each team member so that the proposal could get underway.

WEEK 02
We played Planning Poker during our tutorial session so that we could estimate the user story points for each user story.
By the end of this week I had almost fully completed the storyboard, however, I just needed to finalise the position of
the graphics so they are better displayed on the A4 page of the report. We have decided that each group member should have
their part of the proposal done by Monday so that we can finalise it before we begin our first sprint.

WEEK 03
Monday: I have finalised the storyboards and added them to the proposal document. I have subdivided the storyboards based on
similar user stories to make them easier to read.
