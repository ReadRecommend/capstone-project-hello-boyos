Week 1
For the first tutorial I joined a team, and discussed with them the time and date of the next meeting, as well as our strengths
Created as many user stories as I could from reading the project description, and then combined it with my group members
Assisted with cutting down all of our user stories to remove duplicates and ensure we have entirely covered the scope
Assisted with giving responsibilities and jobs to everyone before the next meeting, where I was assigned to keep the style of the proposal nice, assist with storyboards and generally assist others with their tasks

Week 2
Meeting with team on Wednesday
Collaborated and researched with the team to work out and decide on what software and languages to use on our programs
Decided on Postgresql for backend, Flask, SQLalchemy, and React.
Did planning poker with the team to allocate story points to the user stories
Discussed with team on the priority of user stories
Assisted with giving responsibilities and jobs to everyone before the next meeting, where I was assigned to write the architecture section of the report and research whether to use PostgreSQL or SQLite, etc.
Began working on the architecture section of the report
Researched into the different technologies and libraries we can make use of, and how they fit together
Completed the system architecture section of the report, including diagram
Edited the diagram and report to mention that Flask will be primarily a RESTful API, based on feedback from peers
